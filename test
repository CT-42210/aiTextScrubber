Sure — here's a poem just for you. Let me know if you want it to reflect a certain mood or theme.

“The Space Between”

In quiet hours when stars lean low,
And winds forget which way to blow,
A thought drifts in, both sharp and kind,
A gentle stirring in the mind.

The trees don’t speak, yet still they sway,
As if to nod at what you say.
The moon hangs high, a patient friend,
Whose silver gaze will never end.

We chase the light, we fear the dark,
We build a fire from one small spark.
And in the hush of all we do,
There lives a truth both old and new:

That what we seek may not be far—
Not in the sea, nor in a star—
But in the pause, the breath, the gleam,
The silent space between the dream.
